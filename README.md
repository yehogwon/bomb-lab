 > This is a bomb made by **Dr. Evil**. Disarm it by finding the key in the bomb! 

This **Bomb Lab** assignment is retrieved from [CS:APP Lab Assigments](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html). This helps students practice the skills of reverse engineering and debugging using tools such as `gdb`. Also, by defusing the bomb, students would be able to get familiar with Linux environment and assembly language. 

This repository is consists of the following files:

 - [`bomb.c`](bomb.c) - The source code of the bomb. There are 
 - [`bomb` ](bomb)- The executable file of the bomb. 
 - [`README`](README) - The identification of the bomb. (not this file)
 - [`README.md`](README.md) - This file, about this bomb and repository. 
- [`solution.md`](solution.md) - The solution of the bomb. *This file is to be updated.* 

The binary bomb consists of 6 phases. Each phase requires a specific input to defuse the bomb. The bomb is defused if all 6 phases are defused. The input string can be found from the assembly code of each phase. Go for it!

***‚≠êÔ∏è You can find the solution at [solution.md](solution.md). However, do not see the solution until you solve it by yourself!***
